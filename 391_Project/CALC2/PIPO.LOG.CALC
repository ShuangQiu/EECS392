INFO (XSTRM-288): The automatic layer mapping is done by StreamOut and the xStrmOut_layerMap.txt file is generated. This is because either the layer mapping is not provided or the XST_AUTO_LM value is used with the -layerMap option.
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

WARNING (XSTRM-145): The structure name 'NAND' has been changed to 'NAND_0' by the translator. This is because of either the multiple cells with the same cell name are present in different libraries, a cell name mapping is done to the same cell names, or cell names greater than 32 characters are used when the Respect GDSII Name Limit option is selected.
